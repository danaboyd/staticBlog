I was at a high school graduation the other day, and heard the best valedictorian send off speech ever. This girl managed to get multiple star trek references into her speech, and went on to explain that throughout life she had dreams of becoming Pocahontas, then a princess, then an x-man, then a Vulcan, then Japanese, and maybe I 
donâ€™t know half sloth. Best speech ever.
