I went to Lake Lotus Park today to do some sketching. I didn't realize it was so late in the day, and that the park closes at 5:30. Next time I will remember to get there earlier. Here is a watercolor sketch of a section of the boardwalk.

I haven't been to the park in over 15 years. It's interesting to see the additions they've made.

Also as a side note they are only open Thursdays through Sundays.
