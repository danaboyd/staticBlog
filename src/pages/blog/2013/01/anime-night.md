A sketch from Friday's <a href="http://www.propelleranime.com/">Propeller Anime</a> night at <a href="http://acomicshop.com/">A Comic Shop</a>. They showed Samurai X and Ninja Scroll, two things I remember being much better. Although it has been over 10 years since I first saw them, and memories tend to warp things over time.<a href="https://danaboyd.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/animeNightAComicShop001.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-474" alt="animeNightAComicShop001" src="https://danaboyd.local/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/animeNightAComicShop001.jpg" width="1000" height="611" /></a>
