I went to an Indesign Usergroup meeting yesterday. The session was about publishing digital versions of magazines. The speaker showed us how to use adobe edge to animate elements of the layout. Here's a sketch of his head that I made in tvpaint on my galaxy note 10.1. He had some awesome sideburns.
